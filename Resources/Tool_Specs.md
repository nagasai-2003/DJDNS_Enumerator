DJDNS Enumerator
To build a super powerful DNS enumeration tool, here’s a list of key features and functionalities you should include to make it comprehensive and effective:
1. Basic DNS Record Lookup
A, AAAA records: Retrieves the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the domain.
MX records: Retrieves mail server information for email routing.
NS records: Retrieves the nameservers responsible for the domain.
SOA records: Retrieves information about the start of authority of the domain.
CNAME records: Retrieves canonical names (aliasing) records for subdomains.
TXT records: Retrieves text records, including domain ownership verification and SPF (anti-spam) records.
SRV records: Retrieves service records for specific services (e.g., VoIP, SIP).
PTR records: Retrieves reverse DNS entries to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames.
2. Subdomain Enumeration
Brute-force Subdomain Enumeration: Uses a wordlist to discover subdomains.
Passive Subdomain Enumeration: Gathers subdomains from public sources, including:
Search engines (Google dorks, etc.).
Public DNS databases like VirusTotal, Shodan, and Censys.
Certificate transparency logs.
Recursive Subdomain Discovery: Discover subdomains of subdomains (e.g., sub.sub.example.com).
3. Zone Transfer
Attempts a DNS zone transfer (AXFR) to see if any nameservers are misconfigured and allow full disclosure of DNS zone data.
4. DNSSEC Validation
Checks if the domain has DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) enabled, and if so, verifies the records.
5. Reverse DNS Lookup
Performs reverse lookups (PTR records) to resolve IP addresses back to their corresponding domain names.

6. Wildcards Detection
Detects wildcard DNS entries, which can produce false positives during enumeration.
7. Cache Snooping
Tests for DNS cache snooping vulnerabilities to see if a DNS server reveals cached queries, which can leak information about domain traffic.
8. Geo-IP and ASN Lookup
Maps IP addresses to geographical locations and Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) to identify the network provider.
9. Zone Walking
For domains that use NSEC/NSEC3 records with DNSSEC, attempts zone walking to enumerate additional domains and records.
10. Brute-Force Reverse DNS Lookups
Takes a range of IP addresses (or entire network blocks) and brute-forces PTR records to discover associated domain names.
11. Service Discovery
Attempts to discover running services on common ports, such as:
Web servers (HTTP, HTTPS)
Mail servers (SMTP)
DNS servers (UDP/TCP 53)
FTP, SSH, etc.
Optionally: Use banners or version fingerprints to detect the running software and version.
12. Customizable Wordlists
Allow users to provide custom wordlists for subdomain brute forcing.
Include built-in popular wordlists (e.g., SecLists).
13. Wildcard Subdomain Detection
Identifies if wildcard subdomains are enabled, which could impact accurate results in brute-force or recursive subdomain enumeration.
14. HTTP/HTTPS Detection for Subdomains
After finding subdomains, automatically check if they respond on HTTP/HTTPS and retrieve key information (HTTP headers, SSL/TLS certificate details).
15. API Integrations
Integrate with various APIs to gather additional data:
Shodan API: For passive information about the domain’s IPs and their services.
Censys API: For certificate transparency data.
VirusTotal API: To collect domain and subdomain information.
SecurityTrails API: For passive DNS data.
Spyse API: For enriched data from passive DNS and network scanning.
16. SSL/TLS Certificate Enumeration
Extract SSL/TLS certificates and perform certificate transparency checks to discover subdomains and other related information.
17. CDN and Load Balancer Detection
Identifies whether a domain is using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a load balancer, which could obscure true server information.
18. ASN and Network Range Enumeration
Perform ASN lookups and enumerate all domains and IP addresses within the same Autonomous System Number range.
19. Automated Data Export
Output results in various formats (JSON, XML, CSV, HTML) for integration with other tools or reporting purposes.
20. Advanced Logging
Keep detailed logs of all queries and results for audit purposes.
21. Multi-Threading/Concurrency
Use multi-threading or asynchronous operations for fast enumeration and scanning, especially for brute-force subdomain enumeration and reverse DNS lookups.
22. Error Handling and Retries
Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to deal with timeouts or DNS server failures.
23. Integration with Other Tools
Nmap Integration: After DNS enumeration, optionally run an Nmap scan on the identified IP addresses.
Masscan Integration: For high-speed scanning of large IP ranges.
24. Interactive Mode
Include an interactive mode where users can run individual queries and inspect results step-by-step for a more hands-on approach.

Final Thoughts:
A tool with these features would provide a comprehensive suite for DNS enumeration. You could also make the tool modular so that users can choose which types of scans they want to run (e.g., DNS records, subdomain enumeration, brute-forcing, etc.).
With this feature set, you would cover almost every aspect of DNS enumeration and information gathering, making your tool extremely powerful and versatile for penetration testers and security analysts.
